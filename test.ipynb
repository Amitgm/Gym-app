The floor press limits the range of motion you would achieve with a regular dumbbell bench press, but still targets the chest, triceps, and anterior delts. This allows you to press more weight than in a dumbbell bench press, and perhaps put less stress on the shoulders.',\n",

      "Desc: The face-down incline dumbbell biceps curl is an exercise targeting the biceps and performed face down on an incline bench. This creates a vertical arm angle, which helps to isolate the biceps and limit involvement of the shoulder muscles. This curl variation is usually performed for moderate to high reps, such as 8-12 reps per set or more, as part of upper-body or arm-focused training.\n",

Having the hands higher than the feet makes it easier than wide-grip push-ups on the floor, but the extra width also puts more emphasis on the chest muscles. It can be used as a substitute for wide-grip floor push-ups, or as a mechanical dropset after maxing out on floor push-ups.\n",

It targets all the same muscles as the push-up: chest, triceps, shoulders, upper back, and core. You can balance a plate on your upper back yourself, but it's easier and safer to have someone else put it there. If you stack a few plates up, be sure to have a spotter close at hand.\n",

      "Desc: The weighted pull-up is a more advanced variation of the pull-up exercise in which the lifter adds extra weight to their body. Options for adding weight include a dip belt, weighted vest, chains, a dumbbell placed between the feet or legs, or looping a kettlebell over the foot. Like other pull-up variations, the weighted pull-up builds strength and muscle in the upper back, biceps, and core.\n",

It targets all the same muscles as the deadlift, including the glutes, hamstrings, upper back, lower back, and grip. It can e used to strengthen deadlift lockout, but also as a deadlift alternative for people who can’t deadlift from the floor without pain.\n",

      "Desc: The hex bar deadlift is a variety of deadlift performed in a hexagonal barbell also known as a trap bar. The bar is held with a parallel (palms in) grip outside of the legs.

The trap bar deadlift can be trained in traditional strength and muscle-focused rep range, or for higher reps. It activates all of the same muscle groups as conventional or sumo deadlifts, including the glutes, quads, hamstring, lower back, lats, upper back, and grip.\n",

      "Desc: The barbell thruster is a full-body exercise that incorporates both squatting and pressing in one functional movement. It's especially common in contemporary CrossFit workouts, but also in general strength training. The barbell is usually cleaned into place first, but it could be performed taken from a squat rack in a front-rack position. The thruster can be performed in traditional strength-focused rep ranges to build strength in the press, or in higher reps for full-body conditioning.\n",

It differs from the push-press in that the lifter dips under the bar rather than simply pushing it up. It is popular in CrossFit workouts and Olympic weightlifting, as well as power training for athletics. It is usually performed for low reps, focusing on power and movement quality.\n",

It adds an extra coordination and shoulder challenge to an already intense full-body movement that targets the cardiovascular system as well as a wide range of muscle groups, the shoulders, core, and legs in particular. It can be done as a full-body warm-up, in short bursts for power or circuit training, or for longer durations as cardiovascular conditioning.\n",

      "Desc: The clean and jerk is a full-body lift that is one of two contested lifts in Olympic weightlifting competitions. It is comprised of two movements: the clean, where the bar is pulled from the floor and caught in the front rack position in three pulls or phases, followed by the jerk overhead. The clean and jerk hits every muscle from head to toe and can be the centerpiece of a lifting program. It is also popular in CrossFit and athletic training programs. It is usually performed in low rep ranges, focusing on power and movement quality.\n",

      "Desc: The double-kettlebell push-press is a popular kettlebell movement that involves performing a press with help from the muscles of the lower body. It is preceded by a double clean at the start of each set, and optionally you can perform a clean between each rep. It can be trained in traditional strength or muscle-building rep ranges, in circuit or fat-loss training, or as part of a larger kettlebell combination or complex.\n",

      "Desc: The dumbbell front raise to lateral raise is a dumbbell complex that combines two exercises that build and strengthen the middle deltoids and the anterior deltoids of the shoulders. It is usually performed one rep of each movement at a time, although you could perform more reps of each, or increase the reps in successive rounds (e.g., 1 rep in round 1, 2 reps in round 2, etc.). No matter how you perform it, it targets both the anterior and medial deltoids, making it a great time-efficient shoulder burnout or accessory movement on an upper-body day.\n",

      "Desc: The dumbbell row to triceps kick-back is a dumbbell complex that combines two movements that collectively target the muscles of the lats (latissimus dorsi), upper back, and triceps. It also isometrically targets the core, hamstrings, and glutes. It is usually performed one rep of each movement at a time, although you could perform more reps of each, or increase the reps in successive rounds (e.g., 1 rep in round 1, 2 reps in round 2, etc.). No matter how you structure the sets and reps, it is a time-efficient way to hit two crucial upper-body muscles in any workout.\n",
